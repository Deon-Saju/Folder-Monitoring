# Folder-Monitoring

This script will use watchdog to monitor the specified folder for file creation and deletion events. When a new file or directory is created, it will print a message indicating the type and path of the new item. When a file or directory is deleted, it will similarly print a message. The recursive=True option tells watchdog to monitor subdirectories as well.
